The Random Forest Regression model performed reasonably well, with an R² score of 0.6101. This indicates that the model can explain approximately 61% of the variance in house prices. The top features influencing house prices were area, bathrooms, parking, stories, and bedrooms. These features are likely to be important factors in determining house prices, as they relate to the size, comfort, and convenience of the property.

The importance of area is not surprising, as it is a key factor in determining the value of a property. The number of bathrooms and bedrooms also plays a significant role, as these features are often considered essential for comfort and livability. Parking and stories, while less important, still contribute to the overall value of the property.

These findings suggest that buildings with more stories, higher prices, and larger areas tend to have more bedrooms. The moderate R² score of 0.2665 indicates that the model has some predictive power, but there may be other factors not captured in the dataset that influence the number of bedrooms.

## Recommendations
Based on these findings, we recommend that future analyses consider incorporating additional features that may influence the number of bedrooms, such as the age of the building, location, and architectural style. Additionally, the model could be improved by collecting more data or using more advanced machine learning techniques.",True,1.0,17.59

## Executive Summary
This analysis aimed to identify the most important features for predicting the number of bathrooms in a house. Our results show that the price of the house is the most significant predictor, followed by the area, number of bedrooms, stories, and parking. The Random Forest Regression model achieved an R² score of 0.1139, indicating a moderate level of predictive power.

## Question
What features are most important for predicting the number of bathrooms in a house?

## Methodology
A Random Forest Regression model was trained on the dataset to predict the number of bathrooms in a house. The model evaluated the importance of various features, including price, area, bedrooms, stories, and parking, to determine their relative contribution to the prediction.

## Key Findings
* R² Score: 0.1139
* Top 5 Most Important Features:
	+ Price: 0.4733
	+ Area: 0.1695
	+ Bedrooms: 0.0953
	+ Stories: 0.0447
	+ Parking: 0.0441

## Detailed Results
The Random Forest Regression model revealed that the price of the house is the most important feature for predicting the number of bathrooms, accounting for approximately 47% of the predictive power. This is likely because more expensive houses tend to have more bathrooms. The area of the house is the second most important feature, contributing around 17% to the prediction. The number of bedrooms, stories, and parking also play a role in predicting the number of bathrooms, although to a lesser extent.

## Conclusions
The analysis suggests that the price of the house is the most significant predictor of the number of bathrooms. This is likely due to the fact that more expensive houses tend to have more luxurious features, including additional bathrooms. The area of the house and the number of bedrooms also contribute to the prediction, indicating that larger houses with more bedrooms are more likely to have more bathrooms. While the R² score is moderate, the results provide valuable insights into the relationships between these features and the number of bathrooms.

## Recommendations
Based on these findings, we recommend that future analyses consider including additional features that may be related to the number of bathrooms, such as the age of the house or the presence of certain amenities (e.g., a master suite). Additionally, the model could be improved by collecting more data or using more advanced techniques, such as feature engineering or hyperparameter tuning.",False,0.0,17.43

What features are most important for predicting how many stories there are in a house,run_regression(),run_regression(),True,"the most important features for predicting the number of stories in a house are:
1.  **Price:** The most dominant factor, indicating that more expensive houses tend to have more stories.
2.  **Area:** The total living area of the house is also a significant predictor, as larger homes often require more stories to accommodate their size.
3.  **Bedrooms:** The number of bedrooms correlates with the overall size and potential story count of a house.
4.  **Basement presence/absence:** Whether a house has a basement or not also contributes to predicting its story count, likely due to correlations with overall structural design or footprint.

====================================================

## Executive Summary
This analysis aimed to identify the most important features for predicting the number of stories in a house. Our results show that the top features are price, area, bedrooms, and basement presence, with price being the most significant predictor. These findings can inform real estate professionals and homeowners about the key factors that influence the number of stories in a house.

## Question
What features are most important for predicting how many stories there are in a house

## Methodology
A Random Forest Regression model was trained on the dataset to predict the number of stories in a house based on various features. The model's performance was evaluated using the R² score, which measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

## Key Findings

	+ area: 0.1577
	+ bedrooms: 0.1563
	+ basement_yes: 0.0784
	+ basement_no: 0.0560

## Detailed Results
The Random Forest Regression model achieved an R² score of 0.4323, indicating that approximately 43.23% of the variance in the number of stories can be explained by the features in the model. The top 5 most important features were identified based on their contribution to the model's predictions.

* **Price**: The most important feature, price, contributes 36.76% to the model's predictions. This suggests that the price of a house is a strong indicator of its size and complexity, which in turn affects the number of stories.
* **Area**: The second most important feature, area, contributes 15.77% to the model's predictions. This is expected, as the area of a house is directly related to its size and the number of stories.
* **Bedrooms**: The number of bedrooms is the third most important feature, contributing 15.63% to the model's predictions. This suggests that the number of bedrooms is a good indicator of a house's size and complexity.
* **Basement presence**: The presence or absence of a basement is also an important feature, with basement_yes contributing 7.84% and basement_no contributing 5.60% to the model's predictions. This suggests that the presence of a basement can affect the number of stories in a house.
